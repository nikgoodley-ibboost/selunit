Selunit provides a flexible Maven plugin for executing Selenese HTML test suites
(default Selenium IDE format) in batch and outputs test results in JUnit format.
This allows running, controlling and analyzing Selenium tests and reports
within all modern CI servers and build environments without additional tools.
It was never easier to incorporate Selenium tests from Selenium IDE directly
into your continuous integration process.
